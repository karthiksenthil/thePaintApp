III. INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE SOFTWARE

This application is an attempt to implement the features available in paint applications available on various operating systems.
Currently the following features have been implemented. Instructions to use each is also mentioned alongwith it.

1) DRAW feature
   The Rotating Teapot paint application allows the user to draw the basic primitives with ease, by integrating it completely with mouse functionalities. In order to draw a figure, right click anywhere on the screen to get a Menu. Go to the Sub-Menu "DRAW" and click on the required primitive.

    1.1) For LINE, left click at any 2 points on the screen.These are the 2 end vertices of the required line. 
    1.2) For CIRCLE, click any where on the screen to select the centre ,and then click another point to mark its radius.
    1.3) For TRIANGLE. click at any 3 points on the screen to draw a triangle between the 3 selected points


2) SAVE feature
   This paint application also allows the user to save his precious progress/work at any point of time.To save, again right click anywhere on the screen and click on the SAVE option.Please wait while your progress/data is saved to the disk.

3) COLOURS feature
   In order to make your work more colourful, the application allows you to change the global colour for any drawing at any point of time.When not in any drawing option, click on any of the colours to set it as the global colour for drawing the upcoming figures.

4) OPEN feature
   This feature allows you to open/load the last saved version of your work.Right click on the screen and click the OPEN option to do so.

5) TRANSFORMERS feature
   The application allows you to transform the primitives that you have drawn(and save them). In the current version, 2 primary transforms namely TRANSLATION and LINE/POLYGON CLIPPING have been implemented.

   5.1) For TRANSLATION :
	Right click on the screen,navigate to the Transformers option and click on the Translation option.
	The application allows you translate only circles and triangles(as line selection posed lot of issues and threats to remaining code).
	Select the primitive(circle/triangle) that you wish to translate, and click where on the screen you would like to translate it to.
	Save your work after translations to override their previous locations.

   5.2) For LINE/POLYGON CLIPPING :  
	The application allows you to clip any set of lines or traingle by specifying a clipping window of your choice.For the same,right click on the screen and navigate to the Transformers option and click on the Line Clipping option.
	Specify the Top left corner of your clipping window by your first click and the Bottom right corner with your second click.
	All the lines(including sides of triangles), enclosed within this box are clipped accordingly. Note : This change is not permanent,and cannot be saved.
